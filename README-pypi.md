# forgy
**forgy** is a powerful file organizer and e-book manager with a command-line interface for reliable retrieval of e-book metadata and easy renaming of PDF e-books.

With **forgy**, you can automatically extract valid ISBNs from many PDF e-books, get metadata for ebooks using extracted ISBNs, rename 'unknown' books using retrieved metadata, organize
a messy file collection into folders according to their formats, and much more. This project arose due to the perceived need to reliably rename e-books with their correct titles while
keeping them organized on a computer, without installing and depending on bloated software with busy interface. 

The goal is to easily create and maintain a decent personal PDF e-book library, especially when identifying PDF e-books by their names becomes difficult. The name **forgy** is from the project's roots as a **f**ile **org**anizer in P**y**thon.

**Note:** Development and testing was done on a Windows 10 PC, with python ```3.12``` installed, in such a way as to ensure platform independence. Feel free to try forgy out on other
platforms.

## Usage
**forgy** can be used via its CLI (recommended) or by importing or calling its public APIs directly. The CLI option currently has more documentation and is therefore recommended.
This section assumes that you have installed forgy via ```pip``` as earlier explained.

1. Check whether the commandline tool is properly installed on your computer. Once you enter ***forgy*** in your command line, you should see the Namespace object from parser.
    ```
    Namespace(subcommands=None)
    Please provide a valid subcommand
     ```
   If you see the above, forgy CLI should be accessible via command prompt. However, if that is not the case, you may need to add python Scripts to your PATH to enable execution of the
   CLI.
   <br/>
   <br/>
2. To view help page to understand all sub-commands available in **forgy**, pass the **h***elp argument to forgy.
   
   ```forgy -h```

   
   Sample output:
   
   ```cmd
   usage: forgy [-h] [--version]
             {get_metadata,get_isbns_from_texts,get_single_metadata,organize_extension,get_files_from_dir,copy_directory_contents,move_directories,delete_files_directories}
             ...
