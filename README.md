# FOrgy
FOrgy is a powerful file organizer that automatically detects ISBN from your PDF books, use the detected ISBN to retrieve book metadata, automatically rename these files (if you so desire), and create for you a decent personal  library of your books.

The name FOrgy is from its capabilities as a File(F)-Organizer-(Org)-built-using-Python (y).
